# Features

- Normal Minecraft controls
- World repeats along all axes, including Y (dig a hole and fall forever!)
- WebSocket connection to server
- Multiplayer support
- For fun, it generates textures procedurally by rendering emoji text into canvas element

# Notes

- Feel free to try to connect to the server `wss://cyc.io27.com`, no guarantees that will always be available
- You can also play locally which will save it to your browser's local storage
- Note that you need to click on a server name and user name before clicking Connect or Select, the UI does not really do well indicating what is selected
